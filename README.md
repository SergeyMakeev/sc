"Platform independent" co-routine library exposed through a minimal C API.
Future plans also include a type-safe C++ API.

I say "platform independent" since it *technically* supports a heap of
different platforms, but the projects are not yet set up to support them.

Currently supported compilers/configurations:

* VS2015 (x86, x86_64; `genie vs2015`)
* VS2013 (x86, x86_64; `genie vs2013`)
* MinGW (x86, x86_64; `genie --gcc=mingw gmake`)

Uses assembly from [boost::context] to do the heavy lifting.

Building
--------

Project generation is done through [GENie].

1. Ensure submodules are up to date by running `git submodule update --init`.
2. Download [GENie][GENie-dl].
3. Run `genie <action>` in the root folder to generate project files. Refer to
   the compiler list above for the supported actions, or `genie --help` for the
   full list.
4. Open up the **build** folder and build the projects.

To run the tests, build and run the **sc_tests** project.
