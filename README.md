Based on assembly from [boost::context].

Building
--------

Project generation is done through [GENie][GENie-dl].

#### Linux (x86, x86_64)

1. Generate makefiles.

        genie --gcc=linux gmake

2. Build your preferred configuration.

        make -C build/gmake-gcc-linux config=debug32
        make -C build/gmake-gcc-linux config=debug64
        make -C build/gmake-gcc-linux config=release32
        make -C build/gmake-gcc-linux config=release64

#### MinGW (x86, x86_64)

1. Generate makefiles. MinGW-w64's binaries are assumed to be in the `%PATH%`.

        genie --gcc=mingw gmake

2. Build your preferred configuration.

        make -C build/gmake-gcc-mingw config=debug32
        make -C build/gmake-gcc-mingw config=debug64
        make -C build/gmake-gcc-mingw config=release32
        make -C build/gmake-gcc-mingw config=release64

#### OSX (x86, x86_64)

1. Generate makefiles.

        genie --clang=osx gmake

2. Build your preferred configuration.

        make -C build/gmake-clang-osx config=debug32
        make -C build/gmake-clang-osx config=debug64
        make -C build/gmake-clang-osx config=release32
        make -C build/gmake-clang-osx config=release64

#### Visual Studio (x86, x86_64)

1. Generate project files for your preferred version of Visual Studio.

        genie vs2010
        genie vs2012
        genie vs2013
        genie vs2015
        genie vs15

2. Open and build the `build\vs<version>\sc.sln` file.
